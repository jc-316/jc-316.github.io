    description   : >
      Aletha Scott-Mallory, the heart behind UHope CDC, was born in Liberia and came to the United States to pursue her college education at Western Kentucky University. Raised in a close-knit Christian village, Aletha grew up with a deep sense of faith, community, and compassion. Her upbringing instilled in her a lifelong passion for giving back and standing beside those in need. Guided by her faith and a calling to serve, Aletha founded UHope in 2008 with a mission to support homeless men and veterans in rebuilding their lives. Her vision was simple yet powerful: to create a place where people could find shelter, dignity, hope, and the resources to begin again. Since then, she has helped over 1,000 men find stability and purpose through UHopeâ€™s programs. Aletha continues to lead with humility, dedication, and an unwavering belief that true change begins when we come together to uplift one another.

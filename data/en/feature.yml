      At the heart of UHope CDC is a faith-based commitment to healing and community. We invite our residents and supporters to join us in Christian fellowship every Sunday and Bible study on Wednesday nights. These ministries provide spiritual guidance, encouragement, and a sense of belonging, nurturing the whole person—body, mind, and spirit—as they rebuild their lives.
